# F27SA-Labs
During my Software Development 1 course, alongside major coursework, we engaged in coding exercises during lab sessions to deepen our understanding of Java programming. Below are four lab programs I developed in my first semester:
<br>
<br>
(1) Hw Temp Reader
<br>
->This program prompts the user to input temperatures for each month from January to December. The output of the program is structured as follows :
<br>
The hottest month of the year  was Aug. with a temperature of 52.0°C 
<br>
The coldest month of the year Jan. with a temperature of 15.0°C 
<br>
the average temperature of the year is 33.166666666666664°C
<br>
<br>
(2) Popcorn Maker
<br>
->This program does not consist of that much complex coding . it just deals with java.util.Scanner and asking specific questions like required temperature and time , number of packets , etc.
