# F27SA-Labs
During my Software Development 1 course, alongside major coursework, we engaged in coding exercises during lab sessions to deepen our understanding of Java programming. Below are four lab programs I developed in my first semester:
<br>
<br>
(1) Hw Temp Reader
<br>
->This program prompts the user to input temperatures for each month from January to December. The output of the program is structured as follows :
<br>
The hottest month of the year  was Aug. with a temperature of 52.0°C 
<br>
The coldest month of the year Jan. with a temperature of 15.0°C 
<br>
the average temperature of the year is 33.166666666666664°C
<br>
<br>
(2) Popcorn Maker
<br>
->This program does not consist of that much complex coding . it just deals with java.util.Scanner and asking specific questions like required temperature and time , number of packets , etc.
<br>
<br>
(3) Body Mass Index checker
<br>
->The program starts with a welcome note and asking the user to provide his height and weight. Once thats provided, for finding the BMI, the height is first squared and printed in a way that
<br>
=>System.out.println("Youre BMI is ->" + weight / square);
<br>
<br>
Then the height and weight are converted into feet and pound respectively below
<br>
=>double feet = height * 0.3048 * 10;
<br>
=>double pounds = weight * 0.4535 * 10;
<br>
<br>
After all this, an if condition is being added based on what BMI the user has, he or she will be notified if their healthy, underweight, or overweight.
<br>
And finally the program prints users height in both feet and meter, and weight in kilograms and pounds.
